-02 胜利方式 = -02 Victory Types  
科技胜利：尽可能快地发展科研实力,步入近未来时代,解锁相关科技并训练飞天项目单位.飞天项目单位包括 = Science Victory: Develop scientific strength as quickly as possible, enter the near-future era, unlock related technologies, and train space program units. Space program units include:  
1个 发射地球卫星 = 1 Launch Earth Satellite  
1个 启动登月计划 = 1 Initiate Lunar Landing Program  
1个 启动火星殖民 = 1 Initiate Mars Colonization  
3个 启动系外星系探索 = 3 Initiate Extragalactic Exploration

文化胜利：尽可能快地发展文化实力,步入近未来时代以解锁封尘已久的文化分支,完成文化胜利冲刺分支即可解锁 = Cultural Victory: Develop cultural strength as quickly as possible, enter the near-future era to unlock long-forgotten cultural branches, and complete the cultural victory sprint branch to unlock:  
乌托邦计划 = Utopian Project  
建造完毕即获得文化胜利！ = Once constructed, you achieve a Cultural Victory!  
外交胜利：缓和与他国的外交关系,宗主尽可能多的城邦,建造提供外交支持的奇观,尽快集齐14个外交支持,在60回合后解锁 = Diplomatic Victory: Ease diplomatic relations with other nations, vassalize as many city-states as possible, construct wonders that provide diplomatic support, gather 14 diplomatic supports as soon as possible, and unlock after 60 turns:  
众拥之证 = Certificate of Popular Support(Domination Victory)
建造完毕即获得外交胜利！ = Once constructed, you achieve a Diplomatic Victory!  
宗教胜利：提高信仰产出,创立宗教,传播宗教,压制甚至消灭其他宗教,使你的宗教成为世界主流宗教（即成为每个文明半数以上城市的主流宗教）即可获得宗教胜利！ = Religious Victory: Increase faith production, found a religion, spread your religion, suppress or even eliminate other religions, and make your religion the world's mainstream religion (i.e., become the mainstream religion in more than half of every civilization's cities) to achieve a Religious Victory!

Maintain the highest global civilization score at the last turn specified for the Time Victory to achieve it!

-03 市政树和政策切卡 = -03 Civic Tree and Policy Card
和合共生的市政树虽然显示在科技树中,但原则上不能通过科研值加速进步,只能通过文化值进步.在累计足够的文化值后在首都建造栏购买相应的单位并在同一回合消耗以解锁该市政.\n\n由于unciv本身的局限性,和合共生暂时不能新开一个窗口来承载政策切卡系统,政策卡用建筑代替.政策卡建筑一律花费0生产力;回合内在首都购买以生效;分为四类,军事/经济/外交/通用,分别消耗各自的卡槽,其中通用卡槽可以承载另外三个类型的政策卡.\n\n政策卡均在市政树解锁,有着强力的全国增益加成,根据时势合理推行政策实现收益最大化,加速发展尽快取得胜利! = Although CoeHarMod civic tree is displayed in the technology tree, in principle, it cannot accelerate progress through scientific research value, but can only progress through cultural value. After accumulating enough cultural value, the corresponding unit is purchased in the capital construction column and consumed in the same turn to unlock the civic.\n\nDue to the limitations of Unciv itself, the harmonious symbiosis cannot currently open a new window to host the policy card system. Instead, policy cards are replaced by buildings, which all cost 0 productivity. These buildings can be purchased in the capital during a turn to take effect. They are divided into four categories: military, economic, diplomatic, and general. Each category consumes its own card slot, and the general card slot can accommodate policy cards from the other three categories.\n\nPolicy cards are unlocked in the civic tree and provide powerful nationwide bonuses. It is important to implement policies reasonably based on the current situation to maximize benefits, accelerate development, and achieve victory as soon as possible!

-04 区域与奇观 = -04 Regions and Wonders
在和合共生模组中,区域一般指占用一格地块的专属改良和提供此改良的地标建筑.\n\n区域分为专业区域和一般区域两类.专业区域占用1单位区域位;一般区域不占用区域位.区域位来自城市人口,城市每到达1/4/7/10/13/16/19/22/25/28人口便提供单位区域点.专业区域主要有圣地/学院/工业区/商业中心/剧院广场/军营/港口/娱乐中心/水上乐园/保护区/机场(待加入)等；一般区域主要包括水渠/宇航中心/社区(待加入)等.\n\n直接提供相关产出的区域每与2个区域相邻时额外+1相关产出,这些区域同时具有对地形地貌的独特相邻加成规则.\n\n大多数世界奇观需要占用1格地块,提供持久性或一次性收益.需要指出的是,若奇观修剪一半而其他文明建成,会导致原施工地块烂尾,不能再用于其他用途.\n\n根据地势形势合理安排地块功能,实现收益最大化,这是玩家水平判别的关键点. = In the "Harmony and Symbiosis" module, "regions" generally refer to exclusive improvements that occupy one grid of land and the landmark buildings that provide these improvements.\n\nRegions are divided into two categories: specialized regions and general regions. Specialized regions occupy one unit of the region slot, while general regions do not. Region slots are determined by the city's population. For every 1/4/7/10/13/16/19/22/25/28 population, the city provides one unit of the region slot. Specialized regions mainly include Holy Sites, Campuses, Industrial Zones, Commercial Hubs, Theater Squares, Encampments, Harbors, Entertainment Complexes, Water Parks, Preserves, Airports (to be added), etc.; general regions mainly include Aqueducts, Spaceports, Neighborhoods (to be added), etc.\n\nRegions that directly provide related yields receive an additional +1 related yield for every two adjacent regions. These regions also have unique adjacency bonuses based on terrain and landforms.\n\nMost Wonders of the World occupy one grid of land and provide either persistent or one-time benefits. It should be noted that if a wonder is being built but another civilization completes it first, the original construction site will become abandoned and cannot be used for any other purpose.

-05 通用总督与秘密结社 = -05 Governors and Secret Societies
任命总督：\n使用总督头衔即可任命并升级总督。总督头衔随游戏进程解锁，主要通过市政树获得，也可通过建造“市政广场”区域和其中的建筑来获得。此外还可通过建造“西印度交易所”奇观来获得。任命总督后即可将其派遣到城市中行使职责。每种总督文明中仅限保留一个；一次只能指派一个总督到一座城市。\n\n升级总督：\n玩家可使用总督头衔来升级之前任命的总督。每种总督均有独特的升级树。选择升级即可解锁总督的能力，总督在指派城市中就职后即可运用这些能力。\n\n总督特效：\n在城市中就职，发挥总督的特殊能力。\n\n秘密结社本质是全国生效的通用总督，同时不占用城市总督名额。秘密结社往往在特定方位提供更强大的加成。 = Appointing Governors:\nGovernors can be appointed and upgraded using governor titles. These titles unlock as the game progresses, primarily through the civic tree but also by constructing the "Civic Plaza" district and its buildings. Additionally, the "West Indian Exchange" wonder can provide a governor title. Once appointed, governors can be dispatched to cities to perform their duties. Each civilization is limited to having only one governor of each type, and only one governor can be assigned to a city at a time.\n\nUpgrading Governors:\nPlayers can use governor titles to upgrade previously appointed governors. Each governor has a unique upgrade tree. Selecting an upgrade unlocks the governor's abilities, which they can then use while assigned to a city.\n\nGovernor Effects:\nWhen assigned to a city, governors exert their special abilities, providing unique bonuses and effects.\n\nSecret Societies essentially function as universal governors that apply nationally and do not occupy a city's governor slot. These societies often provide more powerful bonuses in specific areas or situations.

-06 伟人 = -06 Great Person
伟人是艺术家、商人、工程师、科学家、将军，或海军统帅，他们能独自改变文明的进程。在CoeHarMod中，有7种伟人：大艺术家、大工程师、大商人、大科学家、大预言家、海军统帅和大将军。 = Great Person are artists, merchants, engineers, scientists, generals, or admirals who can change the course of civilization on their own. In CoeHarMod, there are seven types of great people: Great Artist, Great Engineer, Great Merchant, Great Scientist, Great Prophet, Admiral, and General.

-07 住房 = -07 Housing
住房代表您能在每座城市所拥有的最大数量的公民或人口。住房的基本来源是水资源。如果城市靠近淡水（河流和湖泊），会获得额外2住房；如果靠近海水，会获得额外1住房；同时靠近淡水和海水是按靠近淡水计算住房。玛雅文明具有独特的住房系统。\n大多建筑能提供住房。研究完制陶术后，每座城市都能建造粮仓，其将增加2个住房，随后能修建下水道，下水道也能增加2个住房。其他区域的建筑有时也能增加住房数量，比如军营区域的兵营，学院区域的大学，港口区域的灯塔。您首都城市的宫殿也能增加1个住房。\n每座农场、牧场、种植园，或营地都能供养少量人口——每两个这样的改良设施能提供1个住房。在工业时代之前，用这种方式供养农业人口可支持稍大数量的人口，之后则可使用社区区域供养人口。（社区区域目前还未上线） = Housing represents the maximum number of citizens or population you can have in each city. The basic source of housing is water resources. If a city is near freshwater (rivers and lakes), it will receive an additional 2 housing units; if it is near seawater, it will receive an additional 1 housing unit. If it is near both freshwater and seawater, the housing is calculated based on its proximity to freshwater. The Mayan civilization has a unique housing system.\nMost buildings can provide housing. After researching Ceramics, every city can build a Granary, which will increase housing by 2, and then a Sewage system can be constructed, which can also add 2 housing units. Sometimes, buildings in other districts can also increase the number of housing units, such as the Barracks in the Encampment district, the University in the Campus district, and the Lighthouse in the Harbor district. The Palace in your capital city can also add 1 housing unit.\nEach farm, pasture, plantation, or camp can support a small population - every two such improvements can provide 1 housing unit. Before the Industrial Era, supporting the agricultural population in this way can sustain a slightly larger population, and afterward, the Community district can be used to support the population. (The Community district is currently not available.)

-08 宜居度 = -08 Livability
宜居度用来衡量单一城市中您国民的满意度，衡量方式是看该城市的人口是否拥有所需的相应  宜居度。初始人口从1点开始，每2点人口便需要1点宜居度。满意状态（宜居度为0或1）的城市不会受到任何影响，而高兴状态（宜居度在2到4之间）的城市会得到10%的发展加速和10%的收益加成。此外，欣喜若狂状态（宜居度大于4）的城市会得到20%的发展加速和20%的收益加成。宜居度过低则会引发公民的不满情绪，并对发展和收益产生负面影响。当宜居度状态为“不安”（小于-2）时，您的城市会停止发展，并可能出现叛军。 = Livability measures the satisfaction level of your citizens in a single city, determined by whether the city's population has the required Livability. Starting with an initial population of 1, every 2 points of population require 1 point of Livability. Cities in a satisfied state (with a Livability of 0 or 1) will not be affected, while cities in a happy state (with a Livability between 2 and 4) will receive a 10% development acceleration and a 10% yield bonus. Additionally, cities in an ecstatic state (with a Livability greater than 4) will receive a 20% development acceleration and a 20% yield bonus. Low Livability can lead to dissatisfaction among citizens and negatively impact development and yields. When Livability reaches an "unrest" state (less than -2), your city will stop developing and may even face rebellions.

-09 间谍 = -09 Spy
与文明6的间谍不同，CoeHarMod的间谍本质上是隐身的不可攻击的军事单位，他拥有更广阔的视野用以获取情报，在必要时可以阻挡敌人进军。\n需要注意的是，我方间谍会被敌方间谍看破隐身，这很可能导致我方间谍殉职。 = Unlike spies in Civilization 6, spies in CoeHarMod are essentially stealthy and unattackable military units. They possess a broader field of vision for gathering intelligence and can block enemy advances when necessary.\nIt's important to note that our spies can be detected by enemy spies, potentially leading to their martyrdom. Therefore, it's crucial to use them wisely and avoid detection to ensure their effectiveness and safety.

-10 贸易路线与贸易站 = -10 Trade Routes and Trading Posts
CoeHarMod取消了众神与国王的贸易路线的金钱产出机制，取代的是，在每座与首都连接的城市在贸易路线容量充足时可以修建贸易站，贸易站会根据所在城市的发展情况和文明的科技水平提供金钱产出。 = CoeHarMod has abolished the money generation mechanism of trade routes in Gods & Kings, and instead, allows the construction of trading posts in every city connected to the capital when there is sufficient trade route capacity. These trading posts provide money generation based on the development of the city they are located in and the technological level of the civilization.
